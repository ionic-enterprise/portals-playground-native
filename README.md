# Portals for Native Playground

The intention behind this repository is to provide a starting point to play around with Ionic Portals for iOS and Android.

Ultimately, this project will look like this:

```bash
portals-playground-native/
├─ android/
│  ├─ kotlin/
│  ├─ java/
├─ ios/
│  ├─ ui-kit/
│  ├─ swift-ui/
├─ web/
│  ├─ ionic-angular/
│  ├─ ionic-react/
│  ├─ ionic-vue/
```

This allows playgrounders to mix-and-match starter projects to choose their own tech stack.

Steps like copying over resources and where to add Portals keys will need to be added in addition to general instructions on how to use this repo.
